This input format is very similar to spreadsheet data; it must be entirely numeric. It is essential to represent the data so that the neural network can train from it. Before we look at specific ways to preprocess data, it is important to consider four basic types of data, as defined by [[Cite:stevens1946theory]](http://psychology.okstate.edu/faculty/jgrice/psyc3214/Stevens_FourScales_1946.pdf). Statisticians commonly refer to as the [levels of measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement):\n","\n","* Character Data (strings)\n","    * **Nominal** - Individual discrete items, no order. For example, color, zip code, and shape.\n","    * **Ordinal** - Individual distinct items have an implied order. For example, grade level, job title, Starbucks(tm) coffee size (tall, vente, grande) \n","* Numeric Data\n","    * **Interval** - Numeric values, no defined start.  For example, temperature. You would never say, \"yesterday was twice as hot as today.\"\n","    * **Ratio** - Numeric values, clearly defined start.  For example, speed. You could say, \"The first car is going twice as fast as the second.\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Qo6LOE4tVNgX"},"source":["## Encoding Continuous Values\n","\n","One common transformation is to normalize the inputs.  It is sometimes valuable to normalize numeric inputs in a standard form so that the program can easily compare these two values.  Consider if a friend told you that he received a 10-dollar discount.  Is this a good deal?  Maybe.  But the cost is not normalized.  If your friend purchased a car, the discount is not that good.  If your friend bought lunch, this is an excellent discount!\n","\n","Percentages are a prevalent form of normalization.  If your friend tells you they got 10% off, we know that this is a better discount than 5%.  It does not matter how much the purchase price was.  One widespread machine learning normalization is the Z-Score:\n","\n","$$ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n","\n","To calculate the Z-Score, you also need to calculate the mean(&mu; or $\\bar{x}$) and the standard deviation (&sigma;).  You can calculate the mean with this equation:\n","\n","$$ \\mu = \\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots +x_n}{n} $$\n","\n","The standard deviation is calculated as follows:\n","\n","$$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2} $$\n","\n","The following Python code replaces the mpg with a z-score.  Cars with average MPG will be near zero, above zero is above average, and below zero is below average.  Z-Scores more that 3 above or below are very rare; these are outliers."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"id":"GcPCe4ONVNgY","outputId":"4a3acf9b-51e2-4971-f146-02293372e162","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":236},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675664230399,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":845,"user":{"displayName":"snow

Target encoding can sometimes increase the predictive power of a machine learning model. However, it also dramatically increases the risk of overfitting. Because of this risk, you must take care of using this method.  \n","\n","Generally, target encoding can only be used on a categorical feature when the output of the machine learning model is numeric (regression).\n","\n","The concept of target encoding is straightforward. For each category, we calculate the average target value for that category. Then to encode, we substitute the percent corresponding to the category that the categorical value has. Unlike dummy variables, where you have a column for each category with target encoding, the program only needs a single column. In this way, target coding is more efficient than dummy
