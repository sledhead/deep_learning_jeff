These techniques will allow us to group, sort, and shuffle data sets. These are all essential operations for both data preprocessing and evaluation.\n","\n","## Shuffling a Dataset\n","There may be information lurking in the order of the rows of your dataset. Unless you are dealing with time-series data, the order of the rows should not be significant. Consider if your training set included employees in a company. Perhaps this dataset is ordered by the number of years the employees were with the company. It is okay to have an individual column that specifies years of service. However, having the data in this order might be problematic.  \n","\n","Consider if you were to split the data into training and validation. You could end up with your validation set having only the newer employees and the training set longer-term employees. Separating the data into a k-fold cross validation could have similar problems. Because of these issues, it is important to shuffle the data set.\n","\n","Often shuffling and reindexing are both performed together. Shuffling randomizes the order of the data set. However, it does not change the Pandas row numbers. The following code demonstrates a reshuffle. Notice that the program has not reset the row indexes' first column. Generally, this will not cause any issues and allows tracing back to the original order of the data. However, I usually prefer to reset this index. I reason that I typically do not care about the initial position, and there are a few instances where this unordered index can cause issues."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"73v_sZP17K3P","outputId":"98cec01e-0c4b-417c-f3df-e5c2d984c4a5","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":236},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675757657688,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1135,"user":{"displayName":"snow
